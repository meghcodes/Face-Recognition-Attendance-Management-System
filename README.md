# Face-Recognition-Attendance-Management-System
# ðŸŽ“ Face Recognition Based Attendance Management System

This project automates student attendance using face recognition. The system captures real-time facial data, matches it against pre-registered images, and records attendance with timestamps into both CSV files and a database. It eliminates the need for manual attendance while providing a secure, contactless, and efficient solution for institutions.
